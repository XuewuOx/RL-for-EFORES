# Reinforcement-learning-for-EFORES
**Electric Fleets with On-site Renewable Sources**

This is the source codes for optimal EV charging via reinforcement learning.
The algorithm is Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). 
The problem it solves is the problem of matching clean energy to the charging of vehicles that stay in the charging lot for longer time than the  charging time needed for being fully charged.
